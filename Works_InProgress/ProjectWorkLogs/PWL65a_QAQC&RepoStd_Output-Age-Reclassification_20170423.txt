QAQC Summary
#############

	a. A set of general standardizations, cleanups, and restructurings was performed
	   (see below) after migrating the extension from the archives. Major revisions to 
	   files in deploy\examples were made.

	b. The "Landis.Extension.Output.AgeReclass.dll" extension and the 
	   "LANDIS-II Age Reclass Output 2.0-setup.exe" installer were scratch-built.

	c. The newly-minted installer was used to freshly install Extension-Output-Age-
	   Reclassification on a Windows 10 box and the example "scenario_s1e1.txt" was run.

#############
QAQC Results
#############

	a. All QAQC tests were successfully performed.

	b. Output Age Reclassification has passed QAQC (w/o Metadata).

	c. Will need Metadata added.
