QAQC Summary
#############

	a. QAQC now that "Output Biomass" and "Output Biomass Reclass" have been re-built

	b. The "Landis.Extension.Succession.Biomass.dll" extension and the 
	   "LANDIS-II Biomass Succession 3.2-setup.exe" installer were scratch-built.

	c. The newly-minted installer was used to freshly install Biomass Succession on a 
	    Windows 10 box and the example "scenario_s2e1.txt" was run.



#############
QAQC Results
#############

	a. When Biomass Succession was run with Biomass Harvest, the run was executed without
	   error and passed QAQC. The weather data loaded correctly.

	b. No runtime errors with "Output Biomass" and "Output Biomass Reclass"
