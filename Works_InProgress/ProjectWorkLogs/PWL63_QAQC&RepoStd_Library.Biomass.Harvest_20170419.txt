QAQC Summary
#############

	a. Re-build "Library.Biomass.Harvest-v2.dll". 

	b. Use newly-built "Library.Biomass.Harvest-v2.dll" to re-build Extension 
	   Biomass Harvest, "Landis.Extension.BiomassHarvest.dll" and its installer

	c. QAQC test Extension Biomass Harvest for 100% cohort removal (ie parsing a 
	    prescription w/ a string such as: 
			cohorts 1-20 50-80 (50%)

	d. Re-build "Landis.Extension.BiomassHarvest.dll" and its installer in the LANDIS-II
	   repository, [LANDIS-II-Foundation/Extension-Biomass-Harvest]
