QAQC Summary
#############

	a. The "Landis.Extension.Output.BiomassByAge.dll" extension and the 
	   "LANDIS-II Output Biomass By Age 2.2-setup.exe" installer were scratch-built.

	b. The newly-minted installer was used to freshly install Output Biomass by Age on a 
	    Windows 10 box and the example "scenario_s2e1.txt" was run with the following active
	   extensions,

		"Biomass Succession"		biomass-succession_SetUp_s2e1.txt
		"Base Fire"			base-fire_SetUp_s2e1.txt
		"Base Wind"			base-wind_SetUp_s2e1.txt
		"Output Max Species Age"	output_MaxSppAge.txt
		"Output Biomass-by-Age"		output_Biomass-by-Age.txt

	c. Metadata was provided for the two disturbance extensions as well as the two
	   output extensions

#############
QAQC Results
#############

	a. All QAQC tests were successfully performed.

	b. Output Biomass by Age has passed QAQC.
