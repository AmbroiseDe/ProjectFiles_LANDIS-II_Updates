1) clone fresh Extension-Biomass-Harvest from bmarron18/Extension-Biomass-Harvest 
(This branch is even with LANDIS-II-Foundation:master)

2) rebuild Landis.Extension.BiomassHarvest.dll in VS
(Build successful))

3) delete all .exe installers that come in cloned BiomassHarvest repo
$ git status

        deleted:    deploy/LANDIS-II Biomass Harvest 1.3.1-setup.exe
        deleted:    deploy/LANDIS-II Biomass Harvest 2.0-setup.exe
        deleted:    deploy/LANDIS-II Biomass Harvest 2.0.1-setup.exe
        deleted:    deploy/LANDIS-II Biomass Harvest 2.0.2-setup.exe
        deleted:    deploy/LANDIS-II Biomass Harvest 3.1-setup.exe
        deleted:    deploy/LANDIS-II Biomass Harvest 3.2-setup.exe

4) open Biomass Harvest 3.2.iss in Inno Script Studio; compile (Ctlr-F9)
(generates freshly-built installer ==> LANDIS-II Biomass Harvest 3.2-setup.exe)

5) uninstall the current Biomass Harvest extension in LANDIS (C:\Program Files\LANDIS-II\6.0)
(use Windows Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Programs and Features)

6) run freshly-built Biomass Harvest installer == LANDIS-II Biomass Harvest 3.2-setup.exe
NB. Installer put the files for BiomassHarvest example in C:\Program Files\LANDIS-II\v6\examples\base-wind.	
(easily fixed ==> modify Biomass Harvest 3.2.iss Lines 26 - 30)

7) run BiomassHarvest example (even though in C:\Program Files\LANDIS-II\v6\examples\base-wind)
C:\Program Files\LANDIS-II\v6\examples\base-wind>call landis-ii scenario.txt
