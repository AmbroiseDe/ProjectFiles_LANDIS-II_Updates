####################
Notes to B.Miranda
###################

* "README_OutputBirdHabitat.txt" would benefit from a description of the extension
* NO changes were made to the example files (now in deploy\examples\ 
* Examples do not currently reflect the LANDISII change from "Century" to "NECN"
* Recommend updating the examples to a new set based on the NECNSuccession_s3e1 set in Support-Other
* Cosmetic changes made throughout the repo from "century" to "NECN"
* Build of "Landis.Extension.Output.BirdHabitat.dll" failed b/c missing a reference .dll 
  in "output-bird-habitat.csproj" (This could be traced but you probably know which one is missing)




############
QAQC Summary
#############

	a. A set of general repo standardizations, cleanups, and restructurings was performed
	   (see below).

	b1. The following were scratch-built:
		==> "Landis.Extension.Output.BirdHabitatNECN.dll"
	     	==> "LANDIS-II Output Bird Habitat NECN 0.3-setup.exe" installer

	b2. The following were NOT scratch-built:
		==> "Landis.Extension.Output.BirdHabitat.dll"
		==> "LANDIS-II Output Bird Habitat 0.1-setup.exe" installer





#############
QAQC Results
#############

	a.  Only minor QAQC tests were performed
		==> built assembly
		==> built installer

specific RepoStd actions
##########################


	a. create "README_OutputBirdHabitat.txt"
		==> description of extension to be added by Brian Miranda
		==> basic README info added

	
	b. modify src\"output-bird-habitat.csproj" and "output-bird-habitat-NECN.csproj"
		==> simplify <Reference Include=...> statements
		==> delete reference to .config files
		==> remove
<PropertyGroup>
    <PostBuildEvent>copy $(TargetName).* "C:\Program Files\LANDIS-II\6.0\bin"</PostBuildEvent>
  </PropertyGroup>

		==> remove strange target refs
		==> move Assembly.cs out of Properties\
		==> add

  <OutputPath>bin\Debug\</OutputPath>

  <PropertyGroup>
    <PreBuildEvent>call $(SolutionDir)\install-libs.cmd</PreBuildEvent>
  </PropertyGroup>


		==> modify; VS originally looking for MapFileNames.cs
  <Compile Include="LocalMapFileNames.cs" />


		==> make sure BOTH references added to BOTH .csproj files:
 <Reference Include="Landis.Library.BiomassCohorts-v2">
 <Reference Include="Landis.Library.LeafBiomassCohorts">
	
		
	
	c. deploy\examples\ files 
		==> NO changes made!
		==> NB. examples DO NOT currently reflect the LANDISII change from "Century" to "NECN"
		==> recommend updating the examples to a new set based on the NECNSuccession_s3e1 set



	d. modify installer\ directory
		==> add "package (Setup section) v6.0.iss"
		==> add "package (Code section) v3.iss"
		==> add "LANDIS-II_Binary_license.rtf"
		==> add "EnsureLandisIIDirsUC.iss"



	e. restructure installer\"OutputBirdHabitat_NECN 0.3.iss" and "OutputBirdHabitat 0.1.iss"
		==> MAJOR rvision (removed all SDK)
		==> add standardized .iss format
		==> remove .pdf inclusion into installer
		==> add code documentation
