creating Inno scripts
#########################

http://www.jrsoftware.org/ishelp/index.php?topic=creatinginstallations

A C-like #include directive is supported, which pulls in lines from a separate file into the 
script at the position of the #include directive. The syntax is:
#include "filename.txt"

By default, any leading or trailing whitespace in a directive's value will be stripped. 
It is possible to avoid this by surrounding the directive's value in double quotes (").

flags: replacesameversion
When this flag is used and the file already exists on the user's system and it has the same version number as the file being installed, Setup will compare the files and replace the existing file if their contents differ.
The default behavior (i.e. when this flag isn't used) is to not replace an existing file with the same version number.


uninsneveruninstall
Never remove the file. This flag can be useful when installing very common shared files that shouldn't be deleted under any circumstances, such as MFC DLLs.

Testing 
Landis.Library.BiomassHarvest-v2.dll
#########################################


	a. following team mtg, discovered that we actually DO use Inno Setup for our Windows
	   installer
	a1. installed Kyomoto Inno Studio and Inno compiler 5.5.9(a)


	b. check for .iss and .exe installers in BiomassHarvest
	b1. delete all .exe files
	b2. check GitHub status

	c. check Inno Setup creation of .exe installers w/ Inno Script Studio
	c1. load Biomass Harvest 3.2.iss 	<== Run as is; no changes made
		==> calls the [Setup] section w/ #include "package (Setup section) v6.0.iss"
		==> calls the [Code] section w/  #include "package (Code section) v3.iss"

	c2. compile script (Project ==> Compile (Ctrl-F9))
	c3. a new LANDIS-II Biomass Harvest 3.2-setup.exe appeared!!!
	c4. check GitHub
	c5. Biomass Harvest 3.2.iss works!! Creates LANDIS-II Biomass Harvest 3.2-setup.exe
