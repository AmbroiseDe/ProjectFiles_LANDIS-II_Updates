	"Base Wind"			base-wind_SetUp_s1e1.txt

1>C:\Users\bmarr\Desktop\BaseHarvest\Extension-Base-Harvest\src\PlugIn.cs(300,45,300,53): error CS0117: 'Main' does not contain a definition for 'ResetLib'
========== Build: 0 succeeded, 1 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========


	e. Vincent modified Base Harvest in PlugIn.cs(300,45,300,53)[pull request #20]:

//---------------------------------------------------------------------
 +        public override void CleanUp()
 +        {
 +            Landis.Library.SiteHarvest.Main.ResetLib(ModelCore);
 +        }


	f. comment on Slack
I looked at  Landis.Library.SiteHarvest.Main (after forking Library-Site-Harvest) and sure enough, there is no definition or method for 'ResetLib'. Since the change you made in Base Harvest (PlugIn.cs (300,45,300,53)) actually calls ResetLib() and there is no ResetLib() in Landis.Library.SiteHarvest (in Main,cs), how can Base Harvest now be built? Re-building Library-Site-Harvest produces Landis.Library.SiteHarvest-v1.dll which is, I think, the same .dll that is currently in Support-Library-Dlls. Is there another version of Landis.Library.SiteHarvest-v1.dll that we should upload to the Support Library? What should we modify to be able to build Base Harvest because simply commenting out or turning off the pre-build event won't really work since Base Harvest needs to pull in all of the other .dlls from the Support Library.
