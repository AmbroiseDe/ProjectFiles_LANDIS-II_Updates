QAQC Summary
#############

	a. A set of general standardizations, cleanups, and restructurings was performed
	   (see below). Major revisions to files in deploy\examples were made.

	b. The "Landis.Extension.BaseBDA.dll" extension and the 
	   "LANDIS-II Base BDA 3.0-setup.exe" installer were scratch-built.

	c. The newly-minted installer was used to freshly install Base BDA on a 
	    Windows 10 box and the example "scenario.txt" was run.



#############
QAQC Results
#############

	a. All QAQC tests were successfully performed.

	b. Base BDA has passed QAQC.
