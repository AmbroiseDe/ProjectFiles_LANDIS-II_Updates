	a. Landis.Library.BiomassHarvest-v2.dll cannot currently be tested with BiomassHarvest.

	a1 per Rob --Bruce, the biomass harvest example uses Biomass Succession, I believe.  
That is not yet compatible with Biomass Harvest.  So far, only NECN has been made compatible.   
So, let's add "update Biomass Succession" to Austen's list.
