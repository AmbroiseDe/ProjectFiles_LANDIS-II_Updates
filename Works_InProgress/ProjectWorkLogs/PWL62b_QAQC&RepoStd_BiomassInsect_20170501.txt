QAQC Summary
#############

	a. The "Landis.Extension.BiomassInsects.dll" extension and the 
	   "LANDIS-II Biomass Insects 2.0-setup.exe" installer were re-built following
	   the removal of Landis.Extension.Sucession.Biomass.dll as build prerequisite.

	b. The newly-minted installer was used to freshly install Extension-Biomass-Insect on 
	   a Windows 10 box and the example "scenario_s2e2.txt" was run.



#############
QAQC Results
#############

	a. All QAQC tests were successfully performed.

	b. Biomass Insect has passed QAQC.
