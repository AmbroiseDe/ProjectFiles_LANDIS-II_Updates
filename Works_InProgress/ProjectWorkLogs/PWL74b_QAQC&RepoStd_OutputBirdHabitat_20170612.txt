QAQC Summary
#############

	a. Rob cleaned things up considerably; only one (1) .csproj file which is now compiling correctly.

	b. The following were scratch-built:
		==> "Landis.Extension.Output.BirdHabitat.dll"
	     	==> "LANDIS-II Output Bird Habitat-setup.exe" installer

	c. Tested whether the extension is compatible with the Biomass Library by running the example with Biomass Succession.




#############
QAQC Results
#############

	a.  Minor QAQC tests were successfully performed
		==> built assembly
		==> built installer

	b. BiomassSuccession_s2e3 example successfully adapted and added

	c. != Passed QAQC in spite of simple fixes (see below)
