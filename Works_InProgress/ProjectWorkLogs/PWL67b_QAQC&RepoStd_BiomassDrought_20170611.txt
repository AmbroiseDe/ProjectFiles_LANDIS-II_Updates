QAQC Summary
#############

	a. After src code changes the "Landis.Extension.DroughtDisturbance.dll" extension, the 
	    "Landis.Extension.DroughtGenerator.dll", and the 
	   "LANDIS-II Drought Biomass Extension 1.1-setup.exe" installer were scratch-built.

	c. The newly-minted installer was used to freshly install Extension-Biomass-Drought on a 
	    Windows 10 box and the example "scenario_s2e1.txt" was run.

QAQC Results
#############

	a. All QAQC tests were successfully performed

	b. Extension-Biomass-Drought has passed QAQC

	a. rename "README_BiomassDrought1.1.txt"
		==> "README_BiomassDrought1.2.txt"


	b. changed Line 285 ...\drought-disturbance-component\src\PlugIn.cs

old Line285
el.CohortsKilledSpecies = new int[PlugIn.ModelCore.Species.Count];

new Line285
el.CohortsKilledSpecies = new double[PlugIn.ModelCore.Species.Count];


	c. Build "drought-generator.csproj"; copied "Landis.Extension.DroughtGenerator.dll" and
	   "Landis.Extension.DroughtGenerator.pdb" to C:..\drought-disturbance-component\src\bin\Debug
