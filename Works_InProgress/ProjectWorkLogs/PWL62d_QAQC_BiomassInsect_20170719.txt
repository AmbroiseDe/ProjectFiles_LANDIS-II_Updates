Title:				PWL62d_QAQC_Biomass-Insect
Project Description:		LANDIS-II upgrades/corrections
Project ID:			2016SoE021

Origin Date:			19 July 2017
Final Date:			27 July 2017



NB Will have to change set up files in QAQC_Examples (1) BiomassSuccession_s2e2 (2) NECN_s3e3
and in Extension-Biomass-Insects

############
QAQC Summary
#############

	a. Changes from BMiranda merged.
	b. Setup file changes were made to "biomass-insects_InsectDefoliator1_s3e3" and 
	   biomass-insects_InsectDefoliator2_s3e3" to reflect new input variables

	c. install the freshly-minted Extension-Biomass-Insects



	d. The QAQC_Examples folder, NECNs3e3 was used for QAQC. The following extensions were run
	   in NECNs3e3_QAQC/scenario_s3e3.txt:

	"NECN Succession"		NECN-succession_SetUp_s3e2.txt
	"Base Wind"			base-wind_SetUp_s3e3.txt
	"Biomass Insects"	  	biomass-insects_SetUp_s3e3.txt


	d1. setup file changes to "biomass-insects_InsectDefoliator1_s3e3" and biomass-insects_InsectDefoliator2_s3e3"
	    based on InsectParser.cs and error outputs:
