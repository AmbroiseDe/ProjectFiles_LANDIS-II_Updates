Hi Dakota!

Based on your efforts so far (which I consider amazing!), Rob has authorized configuration and process 
changes to the Core-Model. These are in addition to the pending Issues listed on GitHub.

I've listed out my translation of Rob's intentions below; often in question form because in many cases,
you will need to make the call and decide what works best. The big picture here is that the Core-Model
gets updated maybe every two years or so and it is expected that a knowledgable programmer (not a 
scientist) will do the upgrades. That said, making updates straightforward with good documentation is 
a must. Once you figure out the best reconfiguration, I will be updating the L.Bross Developer's Quik
Guide.

pues, Â¡mil gracias!, eh?

	a. Rob wants VisualStudio to be the 'standard' IDE.
	a1. MonoDevelop is considered secondary but I would like to see helpful hints for Linux folks 

	b. provide a ready-to-go, LANDIS-II.sln file along with the appropriate *.csproj files. Having
	to build these with 'premake' from the .lua files every time seems silly. 
	b1. keep the 'premake'machinery but put in a separate directory, for an "if needed" situation
	b2. upgrade to 'premake5'and change the .lua files accordingly?

	c. eliminate the need to pull ANYTHING from Google code repos
	c1. add the .dll files directly from the Google repo (you miraculously found!) to GitHub in the 
	'third-party directory

	d. possible to eliminate the use of NUnit?

	e. make it clear how the current directory structure relates to a Core-Model upgrade
	e1. I interpret this as configuring the directory structure so that it represents a clear 
	'how-to' or 'step-by-step' sequence. Thus, a 'newbie' would easily figure that first you load 
	LANDIS-II.sln into VisualStudio, build it, and then ....??
