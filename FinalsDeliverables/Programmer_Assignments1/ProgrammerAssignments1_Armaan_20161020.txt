Hi Armaan,

Looks like LANDVIZ-Development has a very high priority for Rob so 
we are having you lead this one because of your Java background.
Don't worry, your C# efforts will not go wasted!

Given the GitHub repo and some of the materials from last year's
LANDIS-II training I was able to piece together a set of documents
regarding the workings and supposed workings of the LANDVIZ tool. I will
put these in a .zip file and email them to you. I also looked at the 
GitHub Issues board and they are actually decipherable so we should be 
able to work through them. I will also contact Melissa Lucash 
(research scientist in Rob's lab) about additional changes she would like to see.

I tried running the example (per instructions in the "manual") but
it was a no go. The log is in the .zip.

OK thanks much! The LANDVIZ-Development repo has been forked and the billing code will be GHB2.

task list
##########

	a. get 'example_project' up and running and compare to the "manual"

	b. evaluate the current repository build configuration (this has been a real problem in the Core-Model)
	b1. Is it really straightforward or do you recommend changes? Let me knpw.

	c. tackle the first listed GitHub Issue ("Area units need to be flexible") first

	d. work through the remaining GitHub Issues as you like

	e. make note of changes away from the "manual"; we will probably revise.
