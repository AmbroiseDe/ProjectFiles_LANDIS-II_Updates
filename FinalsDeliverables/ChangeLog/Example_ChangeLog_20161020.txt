Hi All!

Given the upgrades/corrections Rob has in mind, I realize that while GitHub is tremendous for tracking 
line item changes we will need documentation for tracking configuration and process changes. Not to 
get bogged down too much (QAQC stuff is generally a hassle no matter what), I would like folks to use 
this form as a ChangeLog template.  We will keep it in .txt format.

My expectation is that each programmer records change events alpha-numerically and provides a BRIEF 
statement of the change event. Statement detail should be proportional to the difference away from 
the current repo. For example, simple coding changes to a *.cs file will be tracked in GitHub and 
because comments can be added directly into the script, the ChangeLog simply notes the event as,

	a. coding changes to *.cs

On the other hand, pulling in new .dll files into GitHub because we are eliminating pulls from 
(deprecated)Google repos, might be looged as,

	b. change current config which requires pulling in .dll files from (deprecated) Google code 
	repo
	b1. the following files added to Core-model/model/trunk/third-party

Landis.Landscapes.dll
Landis.RasterIO.dll
Landis.RasterIO.Gdal.dll
Landis.SpatialModeling.dll
 
	b2. .dll files pulled from
https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/landis-spatial/
%LibraryFileName%


Note that in b. above there is some insight provided as to why the change is being made. Again this 
is a template so make it work for you given the guidelines above. At the minimum, the start of a 
foray into a LANDIS-II repo (eg, Core-Model, Extension-Base-Harvest, LANDVIZ-Development) will 
require a ChangeLog. You will need to change the header, as appropriate. You may decide it easier to 
create multiple ChangeLogs depending on your work style. Ideally, the ChangeLog.txt file can be open 
(like a true note pad) and entries quickly made while you work.  



Putting it all together, Dakota's actual ChangeLog for working on the Core-Model might look 
something like this:
