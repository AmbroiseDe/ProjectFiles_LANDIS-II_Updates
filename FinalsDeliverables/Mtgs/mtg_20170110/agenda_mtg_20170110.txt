	a. Rob report out
		==> retain instructional .pdf files?

	b. Austen report out

	d. Vincent report out

	e. Bruce report out




	f. Issues BaseHarvest 	==> #3 ready for QAQC testing?
				==> #1 still open, yes?

		Plant only prescription in biomass harvest #3
			lbross, "Matthew, can you provide a sample scenario"

		Add Salvage Logging to Base Harvest? #1
 			add a sort type parameter for standing snag biomass, 
			allow simulation of salvage harvesting

	g. Issues BiomassHarvest 	==> were there commits specifically tied to #10 and #13?
					==> careful with documenting changes!
					==> #1 still open, yes?

		AdjacencyType Input error #10
		
		Biomass Harvest Spray Treatment #1
			Mark stand as sprayed so that the BDA extension can access 
			that info starts with the harvest extension providing the 
			info needed by BDA

		Biomass Harvest not communicating with succession for partial cohort disturbance #13
			When a partial cohort removal is performed, the biomass harvested should be handled 
			by the succession extension such that the appropriate amount of biomass is removed from 
			the site or left on site. For example, typically all leaves are left on site along with 15% 
			of the wood (branches). This functionality seems to have been lost with the updates to the biomass libraries.

			An update: After working at it diligently, I got it to work. However, doing so required large changes 
			to library-biomass-cohorts and library-leaf-biomass-cohorts and some of the harvest libraries.


	h. Issues CoreModel 	==> careful w/ documenting changes!
				

			Replace “Ageing cohorts” with “Growing cohorts” Issue #13 
				==> moved to Library-Succession Change 'Ageing Cohorts' to 'Growing Cohorts' #3
				==> looks like changes made but #3 still open in Library-Succession (no Pull request up to LANDIS Foundation master)
				==> have forked this repo but might be too late document changes with Pull request

			Extension versions should be written in the log file #9
				==> were there commits specifically tied to #9?
