#######################
GitHub Workflow Sketch
#######################


Bruce:
* Fork the to-be-modified repository from https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation.
This will create a clone of the repo, https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/<name of LANDIS repo>
at https://github.com/bmarron18/<name of LANDIS repo>.

* Keep the forked clone (at https://github.com/bmarron18/<name of LANDIS repo>) 'in sync' with the original 
repo (the upstream repository at https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/<name of LANDIS repo>)


Programmer:
* Setup GitHub account and install Git on local (programmer's) computer  

* Based on task (Issue) selection, clone a repo from https://github.com/bmarron18/<name of LANDIS repo> 
to local (programmer's) computer. This becomes the local 'master'. 

* Create a descriptive topic branch from the local (cloned) repo 'master'

* Make changes to the code on the (parallel-to-repo) topic branch

* Perform QA/QC L1: Verify the syntax and content of the change

* Commit the change to the (local) topic branch

* Push the topic branch back up to the https://github.com/bmarron18/<name of LANDIS repo>. This will generate
a Pull Request to bmarron18. 


Bruce:
* Open the Pull Request and select 'Comment'

* Specify QA/QC L2: 1) assign a code reviewer, 2) assign a code check testing procedure 
(per rmscheller) with defined metrics for acceptable model behavior and defined documentation procedures


Programmer:
* Perform QA/QC L2: 1) dialog with reviewer about corrections, typos, etc (tracked in Pull Request), 
2) incorporate agreed-upon code changes code, and 3) complete verification tests

* Notify bmarron18 that QA/QC L2 complete (can be set to auto with email notification)


Bruce:
* Open the (programmer's) updated Pull Request and either merge it 
(to https://github.com/bmarron18/<name of LANDIS repo>) or re-start the comment cycle.

* If the changes are accepted, push the newly-merged repo 
(https://github.com/bmarron18/<name of LANDIS repo>), back up to the upstream repository at 
https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/<name of LANDIS repo>. This will generate 
a Pull Request to rmscheller


Rob:
* Open the (manager's) Pull Request and accept (merge)it, rejectit, or comment on it. Merging will close 
the Pull Request.

* Close the associated Issue

* Track the sequence of resolution efforts using the GitHub tabs, Graphs ==> Network
