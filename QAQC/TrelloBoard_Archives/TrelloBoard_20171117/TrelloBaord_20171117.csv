1,"Info about this ""QAQC To Do"" list","To Do

The items below are LANDIS-II repos that (1) are ready to be QAQC tested (as documented by GitHub ""Merged"" actions or flagged with a ""Ready-for-Testing"" milestone), (2) are ready for standardization and documentation changes, and/or (3) need a new installer to accompany a new release. 

Repo standardization includes:
a) re-organizing and standardizing repo directories \deploy, \src, \testings
b) synchronizing .csproj, .iss, and ExtInfo.txt files
c) standardizing .iss files for easy replication to new extensions
d) easily updatable/replicable README.txt

Typically, new releases will require the additional QAQC step of beta-testing the release (ie, the newly-built installer) against a real (user-defined) dataset.

1) be able to select stands based on highest biomass. This used to be a feature but was removed some time ago (highest av biomass in stand?)
2) when I include SingleRepeat in a prescription, it functions (e.g., repeats 10 years later), but then that prescription is never again used anywhere on the landscape. It seems like a pretty weird bug

Rob's updates from NC",,,,
115,6 Sept,* LANDISII 6.2 installer flags the need for .NET 3.5. When Windows sought these files during LANDISII installation ran into infinite search loop. Had to do a hard reboot and load .NET 3.5 separately (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21). This happened even though the network already has .NET 4 loaded.,"potential issue for new install LANDISII 6.2 (see above)==> request that new users install .NET 3.5 first?
CoreModel is distributed through GitHub ==> should this be standard for extensions? How does having installers on GitHub affect LANDIS Users Group membership requirement?
Library.Succession out of sync ==> src code updated to v2 on 15 Jun and *-v2.dll apparently rebuilt and added to Support-Dlls repo. But deploy/current-release/ in Library-Succession not rebuilt / not updated (still Landis.Library.Succession.dll) [already updated]
Running LANDIS-II (Windows) issue? ==> Microsoft is continuing to fade out Command Prompt in favor of PowerShell. The command-line utility, the option is no longer available on the Power User menu (Windows key + X), on the File menu for File Explorer, and even in the extended context menu (Shift + Right-click). Must add it back; not simple (https://www.windowscentral.com/how-add-open-command-prompt-window-here-back-context-menu-windows-10)",,,,
