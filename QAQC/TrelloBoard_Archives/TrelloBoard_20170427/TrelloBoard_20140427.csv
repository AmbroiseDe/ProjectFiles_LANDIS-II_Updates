1,"Info about this ""QAQC To Do"" list","To Do

The items below are LANDIS-II repos that (1) are ready to be QAQC tested (as documented by GitHub ""Merged"" actions or flagged with a ""Ready-for-Testing"" milestone), (2) are ready for standardization and documentation changes, and/or (3) need a new installer to accompany a new release. 

Repo standardization includes:
a) re-organizing and standardizing repo directories \deploy, \src, \testings
b) synchronizing .csproj, .iss, and ExtInfo.txt files
c) standardizing .iss files for easy replication to new extensions
d) easily updatable/replicable README.txt

Typically, new releases will require the additional QAQC step of beta-testing the release (ie, the newly-built installer) against a real (user-defined) dataset.

1) be able to select stands based on highest biomass. This used to be a feature but was removed some time ago (highest av biomass in stand?)
2) when I include SingleRepeat in a prescription, it functions (e.g., repeats 10 years later), but then that prescription is never again used anywhere on the landscape. It seems like a pretty weird bug

Yes, these positions could fit as an Analyst Programmer classification. A temporary classified appointment can span the duration of 1 year or up to 1039 hours worked, whichever comes first

errors in the code which prevent Biomass Browse from being built. Is this a known problem? Has it ever built? Also please add Landis.Library.BiomassCohorts-vBrowse to the support dll repo","Pull request #3 BaseFire ==> RMS approve? May fix QAQC run issues?
Biomass Harvest ==> Add issues from Brooke (see above)?

Biomass Succession ==> change output anpp map output location (modify Outputs.cs)? Actually, can output maps and .csv files be sent to a folder(s) rather than getting mixed in with the scenario files?
tutorial time ==> can we bill for a few hrs of VS/C# tutorial?
Namespace change ==> what is needed, how to proceed.
