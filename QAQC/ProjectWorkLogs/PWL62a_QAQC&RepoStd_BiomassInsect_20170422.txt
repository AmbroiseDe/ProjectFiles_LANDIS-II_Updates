QAQC Summary
#############

	a. A set of general standardizations, cleanups, and restructurings was performed
	   (see below). Major revisions to files in deploy\examples were made.

	b. The "Landis.Extension.BiomassInsects.dll" extension and the 
	   "LANDIS-II Biomass Insects 2.0-setup.exe" installer were scratch-built.

	c. The newly-minted installer was used to freshly install Extension-Biomass-Insect on 
	   a Windows 10 box and the example "scenario_s2e2.txt" was run.



#############
QAQC Results
#############

	a. All QAQC tests were successfully performed.

	b. Biomass Insect has passed QAQC.

QAQC Sequence
################


	a. VS build of "biomass-insects.csproj"

NB. Had to comment out the "install.cmd" in .csproj to be able to insert 
"Landis.Extension.Succession.Biomass.dll" into \bin\Debug.
Either a code modification is needed to eliminate the eed for having "Landis.Extension.Succession.Biomass.dll" in the Support-DLLs library OR
add this library to the Support-DLLs repo (seems not good)
