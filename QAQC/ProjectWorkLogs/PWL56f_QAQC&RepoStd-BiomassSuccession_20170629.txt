QAQC Summary
#############

	a. Rob cleaned up derelict (duplicate log file) code in Ouputs.cs

		PlugIn.cs(20):        public static readonly string summaryLogFile = "Biomass-succession-v3-log";
		Outputs.cs(24):       string logFileName   = "Biomass-succession-v3-log.csv";

	b. Forked Extension-Biomass-Succession, rebuilt .dll and installer w/ Rob's new code

	c. Ran C:\Program Files\LANDIS-II\v6\examples\Biomass Succession\scenario_s2e1.txt
	   w/ the following active extensions (set RandomNumber = 147):

		"Biomass Succession"		biomass-succession_SetUp_s2e1.txt
		"Base Wind"			base-wind_SetUp_s2e1.txt
		"Biomass Harvest"		biomass-harvest_SetUp_s2e1.txt
		"Output Max Species Age"	output_MaxSppAge.txt
		"Output Biomass-by-Age"		output_Biomass-by-Age.txt

	d. Examined "Biomass-succession-v3-log" and "spp-biomass-log.csv" with reference to previous QAQC run in
	   PWL56e_QAQC&RepoStd-BiomassSuccession
		==> all values identical for both logs (as they should be b/c same random number seed)

	e. The same issue of a 'non-issue' 
		==> no zero-year biomass reported for Biomass-succession-v3-log so can't compare log outputs for Year Zero
		==> all subsequent yearly biomass totals match exactly

QAQC Results
#############

	a. Check:
		sum of zero-year biomass (Log1) 	?=? sum of zero-year biomass (Log2) (not possible b/c no zero year output for Log1)
		sum of five-year biomass (Log1) 	= sum of five-year biomass (Log2)
		sum of ten-year biomass (Log1) 		= sum of ten-year biomass (Log2)
		sum of fifteen-year biomass (Log1) 	= sum of fifteen-year biomass (Log2)

	a. Pull "spp-biomass-log.csv" into R
	a1. check data types in cells with "class" (R keeps C# data types)
	a2. change all data cells [ , 4:37] to numeric
	a3. sum zero-year biomass across both ecoreegions (subset == [1:2,4:37])
	a4. sum five-year biomass across both ecoreegions (subset == [3:4,4:37])
	a5. sum ten-year biomass across both ecoreegions (subset == [5:6,4:37])
