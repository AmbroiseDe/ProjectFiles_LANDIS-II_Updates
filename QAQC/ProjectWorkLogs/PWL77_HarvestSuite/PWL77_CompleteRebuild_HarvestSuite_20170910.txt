################################
Rebuillding the Harvest Suite
################################


	a. A complete rebuild and reinstall of the entire Harvest Suite means changes to:

		Landis.Library.HarvestManagement-v2.dll 	
		Landis.Library.SiteHarvest-v1.dll 
		Landis.Library.BiomassHarvest-v2.dll
		
		Landis.Extension.BaseHarvest-3.1.1.dll		
		Landis.Extension.BiomassHarvest-3.2.1.dll
		Landis.Extension.Succession.AgeOnly-4.1.2.dll
		Landis.Extension.Succession.Biomass-4.0.3.dll
		Landis.Extension.Succession.NetEcosystemCarbonNitrogen-4.2.2.dll

	b. A complete rebuild can be triggered by changes to Library.Succession because there are direct or 
           indirect calls to Landis.Library.Succession-v5.dll; namely,

Landis.Library.SiteHarvest-v1.dll					<< direct
Landis.Library.HarvestManagement-v2.dll					<< direct
Landis.Library.BiomassHarvest-v2.dll					<< indirect thru SiteHarvest

Landis.Extension.BaseHarvest-3.1.1.dll					<< direct
Landis.Extension.BiomassHarvest-3.2.1.dll				<< direct
Landis.Extension.Succession.AgeOnly-4.1.2.dll				<< direct
Landis.Extension.Succession.Biomass-4.0.3.dll				<< direct
Landis.Extension.Succession.NetEcosystemCarbonNitrogen-4.2.2.dll	<< direct
		

	c. Careful! This suite of repos is terribly cross-linked and there is a hierarchy 
	   of dependecies ==> you must build in this sequence:

	Landis.Library.SiteHarvest-v1.dll

		Landis.Library.HarvestManagement-v2.dll 	
		Landis.Library.BiomassHarvest-v2.dll
		
			Landis.Extension.BaseHarvest-3.1.1.dll		
			Landis.Extension.BiomassHarvest-3.2.1.dll
			Landis.Extension.Succession.AgeOnly-4.1.2.dll
			Landis.Extension.Succession.Biomass-4.0.3.dll
			Landis.Extension.Succession.NetEcosystemCarbonNitrogen-4.2.2.dll

	    That is, build Library.SiteHarvest first
			==> then substitute the freshly-built Landis.Library.SiteHarvest-v1.dll into the src/bin/Debug 
			folder of Library.HarvestManagement and Library.BiomassHarvest and rebuild these two libraries 
				==> then substitute all three now freshly-built libraries into the src/bin/Debug 
				folder of Extension.BaseHarvest and Extension.BiomassHarvest and rebuild these two extensions

	d. You will need to 'leave on' then 'turn off' then 'turn back on' the pre-build command,
	"PreBuildEvent>call $(SolutionDir)\install-libs.cmd</PreBuildEvent" in .csproj files in order to
		a) pull in the requiste libraries from Support-DLLs ('leave on')
		b) rebuild with freshly-built libraries inserted per the hierarchy above ('turn off')
		c) re-set for future builds ('turn back on')

	d1. NB. Step d. above can be avoided for the rebuild of the extensions if, after making changes
	    to the three Harvest libraries, these new rebuilds are pushed to Support-Library-Dlls. Then 
	    only the .csproj file and .iss file will need to be changed and the rebuild will automatically
	    call in the three, newly-built Harvest libraries.

	e. The installers for all of the extensions will also need to be rebuilt

	f. Push all changes back up to LANDIS-Foundation repos 
	f1. Push (ie Pull requests) to all repos
	f2. Add the three freshly-built libraries to Support DLLs repo and likewise make a Pull request 
	   for the changes


	g. On your personal machine, you will need to re-install
		Extension.BaseHarvest	
		Extension.BiomassHarvest
		Extension.Succession.AgeOnly
		Extension.Succession.Biomass
		Extension.Succession.NECN

	h. Notify the site administrator that folks will need to re-install as well
