`	b1. creating an installer

Inno Setup is a free installer for Windows programs. 
Supports creation of a single EXE to install your program for easy online distribution.

Inno Script Studio is a new intuitive graphical interface for generating and compiling scripts for 
the award winning Inno Setup compiler from Jordan Russell.

The MSI Wrapper was produced to create MSI packages from executable files built with Inno Setup. 
It puts the setup.exe inside an MSI file and runs it with the specified command line switches when the MSI package is installed.

	c. confusion!
How do we create Wizard installers? Use Inno Setup alone? Use Inno Setup w/ MSI Wrapper? Ue Advanced Installer?

Start Menu folder:

Additional tasks:
