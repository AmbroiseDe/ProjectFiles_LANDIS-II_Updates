\maketitle
This memo provides an update on the status of the tasks assigned to the LANDIS-II Software Enhancement Project (\enquote{Project}). Specific and general tasks as well as priorities for the Project are defined by the document dated September 7, 2016.  The following provides an update on a per task basis, referencing the task numbers in the September 7, 2016 document.\\

\section*{Top Priority}
\begin{description}
  \item[Task 1 -- Integrate climate library into appropriate extensions]
  \item[Task 2 -- Re-engineer the Site Tool]
  \item[Task 3 -- Add Metadata library for LANDVIZ compatibility to all extensions] A 
  \item[Task 4 -- Develop R scripts to run the model and generate LANDVIZ web sites]
  \item[Task 5 -- Provide enhancements and bug fixes for LANDVIZ] LANDVIZ now accepts non-integer hectare area for input rasters. The PreProcTool and its Python dependencies (including PyInstaller) have been updated to allow for rebuilds of LANDVIZ. A step-by-step rebuild protocol has been defined and documented. This task is 100\% completed.
  \item[Task 6 -- Fix remaining bugs in Harvest]
  \item[Task 7 -- Implement a prescribed burning option]
  \item[Task 8 -- Perform maintenance and add enhancements to Core Model] Rebuilding Core Model is now a streamlined and well-documented five-stage process. Core Model enhancements include adding the names of all input files to the log, writing all extension versions to log, providing species name in error messages, providing the version that is installed, and replacing “Ageing cohorts” with “Growing cohorts” in console. This task is 100\% completed.
\end{description}

\section*{Secondary Priority}
\begin{description}
  \item[Task 9 -- Integrate Forest Service vegetation data]
  \item[Task 10 -- Make Landscape Builder compatible with biomass succession extensions]
  \item[Task 11 -- Improve error messages (more informative) throughout LANDIS-II]
  \item[Task 12 -- Develop tools to build all input maps]
  \item[Task 13 -- Revise all UGs for clarity and currency.]
  \item[Task 14 -- Develop links between FVS and LANDIS-II ]
  \item[Task 15 -- Develop outputs for NFS]
  \item[Task 16 -- Enable use of American fuel models in the Dynamic Fire and Fuels extensions]  
\end{description}

In addition to the above, all repositories under Rob Scheller are slated for major restructuring and standardization. The restructuring and standardization includes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Standardization of the Visual Studio .dll build process through a) modification of .csproj files, b) installation of .cmd files, and c) referencing the Support-Library-DLLs repository. The standardization provides error-free extension builds in Visual Studio.
  \item Standardization of .iss files for building error-free extension installers in Inno Setup.
  \item Standardization and clean-up of all extension-installed scenarios for running error-free examples.
  \item Standardization of repository structure for consistency and ease of access to repository materials.
  \item Standardization and augmentation of the README files.
\end{itemize}
The restructuring and standardization task is about 75\% completed.
