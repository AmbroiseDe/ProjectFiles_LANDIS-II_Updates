to do 
#######

* Go to LANDIS-II Foundation homepage (http://www.landis-ii.org/) and	
	-- become a member of the LANDIS-II Users Group (under Install)
	-- become a memebr of the LANDIS-II Developers Group (under Developers)

* Install VisualStudio (and/or MonoDevelop)

* Install git (and your favorite interface TortoiseGit?)

* Download your timesheet template

* Remember to start tracking your hours! (round to the nearest 0.5 hr)


#####################
options for the week
#####################

* do a test run of LANDIS-II and checkout some of the output (see QuikStart)

* test out Pull Requests with some dummy changes to the Core-Model

* think about your prefered method for team use of GitHub 


###############################
notes / questions
(mostly reflecting my ignorance)
#################################

* How does git interface with VisualStudio and MonoDevelop? Clone the repo 
directly into IDE?

* Does a call to "Build"  compiles .cs files to a .dll?

* How does one interface the Core-Model files with Solutions and Projects 
under Mono? Must open ALL .cs files b/c cross-correlated?

* Slack looks very cool! (Thanks Dakota!) Should we use this (or perhaps 
Basecamp3?) as a team communication tool?
