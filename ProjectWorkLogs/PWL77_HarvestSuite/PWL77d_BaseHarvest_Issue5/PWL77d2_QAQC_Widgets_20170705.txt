QAQC Summary
#############

	a. ResetLib() for InitilizePhase2() and CleanUp() methods were added to Library-Site-Harvest and 
	   Landis.Library.SiteHarvest-v1.dll was rebuilt. The freshly-rebuilt Landis.Library.SiteHarvest-v1.dll was included 
	   in a rebuild of Base Harvest (Landis.Extension.BaseHarvest.dll) and a rebuild of the Base Harvest installer. Base 
	   Harvest was uninstalled and re-installed. QAQC_Example, AgeOnlySuccession_s1e1 (which calls Base Harvest) was 
	   opened in the widget, Landis-II Replicator. Two replicate runs were selected. The first run was completed; the 
	   second run failed.
