QAQC Summary
#############

	1. The prescription, OakPatchCutting in base-harvest_SetUp_s1e1.txt contains the 
	   cohort keyword "AllExceptOldest". This prescription was modified along with 
	   base-harvest_SetUp_s1e1.txt to ensure its realization.

	2. Checking the output in base-harvest-event-log.csv confirmed the prescription using
	   cohort keyword "AllExceptOldest" was implemented.

	3. This does not appear to be an issue. Perhaps an operator error?

	a.  history
https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Extension-Base-Harvest/issues/28

From a diligent user:
"Error reading input value for Age or Age Range: AllExceptOldest is not a valid integer". 
The model doesn't like AllExceptOldest keyword in my harvest file which I don't know why.

	b. In BaseHarvest, \deploy\examples\base-harvest_SetUp_s1e1.txt has a prescription that uses 
	   the "AllExceptOldest" keyword.

	c. Modified base-harvest_SetUp_s1e1.txt Prescription OakPatchCutting to run in Management area 1
	   with the following:

	querrubr 	AllExceptOldest
	pinubank 	AllExceptOldest


	d. run
C:\Users\bdmarron\Desktop\BaseHarvest\Extension-Base-Harvest\deploy\examples>call landis-ii scenario_s1e1.txt
LANDIS-II 6.2 (official release)

Loading scenario from file "scenario_s1e1.txt" ...

Model run is complete.


	e. Checking the output in base-harvest-event-log.csv shows harvest events for pinubank using the
	   cohort keyword "AllExceptOldest"

	f. This does not appear to be an issue. Operator error?
