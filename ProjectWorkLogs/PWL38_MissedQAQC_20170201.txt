1. Issue #10 Extension-Biomass-Harvest:
AdjacencyType Input error #10 

2. Austen determined the problem was actually in Library-Biomass-Harvest:
Problem with allowing 100% thinning

3. Austen changed code in Library-Biomass-Harvest/trunk/src/PartialThinning.cs:
if (percentage.Value < 0.0 || percentage.Value > 0.99)
 throw MakeInputValueException(valueAsStr.ToString(),
  string.Format("{0} is not between 0% and 99%.  100% is indicated by leaving out the %.", word));
  

4. Austen generated a pull request in Library-Biomass-Harvest directly to Rob; Rob merged:
Pull request #1 in Library-Biomass-Harvest
Merge pull request #1 from aruzicka555/master
Fix for allowing total thinning
Slightly altered percentage check to explicitly compare the percentage's
value to ensure it is between 0-99%. Also rearranged unreachable code to
throw an exception if a percentage is not specified.

5. Bruce thought Extension-Base-Harvest rebuilds Landis.Library.BiomassHarvest-v2.dll but this
incorrect ==> just pulls in Landis.Library.BiomassHarvest-v2.dll from Support-Library-DLLs
just like all other required .dlls

6. Bruce sent Pull request to Support-Library-Dlls for an updated Landis.Library.BiomassHarvest-v2.dll 
to be added (thinking that a re-build of Extension-Biomass-Harvest also re-built
Landis.Library.BiomassHarvest-v2.dll). This Pull request did nothing more than replace 
Landis.Library.BiomassHarvest-v2.dll with itself; Rob merged
