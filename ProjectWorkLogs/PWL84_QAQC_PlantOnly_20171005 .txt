QAQC Summary
#############

	1. "PlantOnly" is a harvest prescription where "No cohorts of any species will be removed 
	but reproduction will occur according to the succession extension." 
		(from the UG for BaseHarvest)

	2. LBross made changes in Biomass Harvest so that output from PlantOnly prescriptions are
	   written as they are in Base Harvest.

	3. LBross' changes were checked by modifying an identical  prescription in both Base Harvest and 
	   Biomass Harvest and comparing the "base-harvest-event-log.csv" to the 
	   "biomass-harvest-event-log.csv".

	4. In both cases, The fields, "Time","ManagementArea","Prescription","Stand","EventID",
	   "StandAge", "StandRank", and "NumberOfSites" all report data indicating that PlantOnly 
	   was active. All other fields reported zero (ie no harvest).

QAQC sequence

	a.  history
	a1. there is (undocumented) keyword for the CohortsRemoved parameter: PlantOnly
	a2. LBross made changes in Biomass Harvest so that entries from PlantOnly prescriptions are
	being written as they are in Base Harvest

LBross commit Implement LANDIS-II-Foundation/Extension-Base-Harvest#3: Plant-only prescription
https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Extension-Biomass-Harvest/commit/6a02f17a42597218c91131b806c318966a19b75a

	a3. there should be log information to report that planting had occurred
	a4. If PlantOnly is used in lieu of ClearCut or SpeciesList, the species are scheduled for 
	planting but no harvesting occurs.
	a5. Plant only prescriptions do appear in the event log for Base Harvest in the format that
	Rob suggested. The first several columns contain information, but all the harvesting values 
	are populated with zeroes
	a6. "PlantOnly" – No cohorts of any species will be removed but reproduction will occur 
	according to the succession extension (from the UG for BaseHarvest)


	b.Perform a test run with the PlantOnly prescription in Base Harvest and in Biomass
	Harvest as QAQC tests. Biomass output for PlantOnly prescriptions should mimic
	the output for Base Harvest (ie several columns of information indicating that the prescription
	was active followed by zeroes indicating no harvest)

	c. Run Base Harvest with a MaxAgePlant Prescription in "base-harvest_SetUp_s1e1_QAQC.txt":

>>---- PRESCRIPTION_1 ---------------------------------------

    StandRanking 	MaxCohortAge
    SiteSelection 	Complete

	c2. check output in "base-harvest-event-log.csv"
The fields, 
Time	ManagementArea	Prescription	Stand	EventID	StandAge	StandRank	NumberOfSites

all report data indicating that PlantOnly was active. All other fields are zero (ie no harvest)
