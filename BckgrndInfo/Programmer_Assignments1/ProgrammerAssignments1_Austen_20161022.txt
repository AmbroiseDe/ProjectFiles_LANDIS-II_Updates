Hi Austen!

According to Rob, the Harvest updates are the most convoluted and will probably take
quite a bit of time. You've got the lead on this one and ideally, both Dakota and Armaan
will be able to jump in once their work the Core and LANDVIZ is done.

Looks like we will have to spend a bit of time deciphering the Issues list (I may even need 
to check in with Rob). In the meantime, however, I discovered the first major piece of the 
upgrade: getting rid of the SDK interface. Rob very much dislikes the need for 
SDK to be able to fire up a VirtualStudio solution and begin reprogramming to create a new
extension. He sees it as definitely not 'scientist friendly.' Sounds like you had trouble
with the first step (running the .cmd file). 

I was able to get a functional run of the Base Harvest extension using materials Melissa Lucash 
(research scientist in Rob's lab) presented at a LANDIS training last year. I will send you a 
.zip file with all of the materials plus my log of the successful run. At least the extension 
currently works to some level!

OK thanks so much Austen!!

task items
###################

	a. duplicate the Lucash training example run on LANDIS-II (see my run log)

	b. restructure/reconfigure Extension-Base-Harvest/src/ so that SDK is NOT
	required to build the extension
	b1. Rebuilding the Base Harvest extension should require ONLY that a single
	VisualStudio .sln file be uploaded to VS (or MonDevelop)

	c. check to see if the extension will run given the current set of files
	in the Extension-Base-Harvest/tests/v6.0-2.0
	c1. I tried running these and it was a 'no go.' We may end up replacing this
	set of files with the ones from Melissa's training.
