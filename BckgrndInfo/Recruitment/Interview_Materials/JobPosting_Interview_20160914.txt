Job Posting
##################


Mid level C# developer - $20/yr part-time working as part of a team to provide upgrades and bug fixes 
to the LANDIS-II forest landscape change model.

The Dynamic Ecosystems and Landscapes Lab, under the direction of Dr. Robert Scheller, has immediate
need for three (3) mid-level C# developers to implement upgrades and bug fixes to the LANDIS-II forest landscape change model
and its various extensions. LANDIS-II is an open-source, spatially-explicit, process-based simulation model of LANdscape DIsturbance and succession. 
LANDIS-II is sponsored by the LANDIS-II Foundation, a not-for-profit 501(3)(c) scientific and educational organization.

Job Summary:
Developers (C#) are responsible for modification and generation of well-commented code that accurately implements corrections and 
updates to the LANDIS-II core model and its various extensions as defined by open tickets from key scientific users.  Developers 
are expected to use sound engineering practices and are expected to perform and participate in all necessary QA/QC procedures and practices 
including code review, code testing, task branching, and work logs to produce well-documented, model-verified results. Devlopers must be 
comfortable working autonomously as well as within a collaborative problem solving environment. Develoeprs are expected to work 10-15 hr/wk 
throughout the anticipated 30 weeks of the project. Expected start date is October 10, 2016.

Your Reponsibilities:
	Access the LANDIS-II Foundation's GitHub repository to self-select job tasks from open ticket items (Issues on GitHub)
	Analyze open ticket change requests in light of C# and the LANDIS-II modeling environment
	Work autonomously to design draft coding solutions to open ticket items
	Work collectively with other Developers and the Project Manager to perform code review and testing to 
	produce final coding solutions to open ticket items
	Rigorously and consistently implement all project QA/QC procedures and practices including revision control, work logs,
	unit testing and code reviews, by and for peers

Your Skills:
	Strong understanding of object-oriented programming
	Strong understanding of iterative problem solving (analysis, design, coding, testing, repeat)
	Knack for writing clean, well-commented, and readable C# code
	Proficient in C#, with a good knowledge of its ecosystems and architectures
	Experience with Git and GitHub as code versioning control tools 
	Experience with IDEs for C# (Visual Studio 2015 or MonoDevelop)
